==============

## Welcome to the AKS on Azure Stack HCI (Preview) in Azure - Eval Guide ##

In this guide, we'll walk you deploying the [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) on Azure Stack HCI (currently in preview) in an Azure VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/aks-hci/overview "link to the What is Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI documentation landing page"), and set the foundation for you to explore in your own time.  You'll cover aspects such as:

* Deploying and configuring a Windows Server 2019 Azure VM to host the infrastructure

What is AKS on Azure Stack HCI?
-----------

If you've landed on this page, and you're still wondering what AKS on Azure Stack HCI is, Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI, **currently in public preview**, is an on-premises implementation of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), which automates running containerized applications at scale. Azure Kubernetes Service is now in preview on Azure Stack HCI 20H2 and Windows Server 2019 Datacenter-based clusters, making it quicker to get started hosting Linux and Windows containers in your datacenter.

If you're interested in learning more about what AKS on Azure Stack HCI is, make sure you [check out the official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/aks-hci/overview "What is Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI documentation"), before coming back to continue your evaluation experience. We'll refer to the docs in various places in the guide, to help you build your knowledge of AKS on Azure Stack HCI.

Why follow this guide?
-----------

This evaluation guide will walk you through standing up a sandboxed, isolated AKS on Azure Stack HCI environment using **nested virtualization** in Azure.  Whilst not designed as a production scenario, the important takeaway here is, by following this guide, you'll lay down a solid foundation on to which you can explore additional AKS on Azure Stack HCI scenarios in the future, so keep checking back for additional scenarios over time.

Evaluate AKS on Azure Stack HCI using Nested Virtualization
-----------

As with any infrastructure technology, in order to test, validate and evaluate the technology, there's typically a requirement for hardware.  If you're fortunate enough to have multiple server-class pieces of hardware going spare (ideally hardware validated for Azure Stack HCI, found on our [Azure Stack HCI Catalog](https://aka.ms/azurestackhcicatalog "Azure Stack HCI Catalog")), you can certainly perform a more real-world evaluation of AKS on Azure Stack HCI. For those that don't have spare hardware, using nested virtualization can be a great alternative for evaluation.

If you're not familiar with nested virtualization, at a high level, it allows a virtualization platform, such as Hyper-V, or VMware ESXi, to run virtual machines that, within those virtual machines, run a virtualization platform. It may be easier to think about this in an architectural view.

![Nested virtualization architecture](media/nested_virt.png "Nested virtualization architecture")

As you can see from the graphic, at the base layer, you have physical hardware, onto which you install a hypervisor. In this case, for our example, we're using Windows Server 2019 with the Hyper-V role enabled.  The hypervisor on the lowest level is considered L0 or the level 0 hypervisor.  In Azure, you don't have access or control over this. On that physical host, you create a virtual machine, and into that virtual machine, you deploy an OS that itself, has a hypervisor enabled.  In this example, that 1st Virtualized Layer is running a **nested** operating system with Hyper-V enabled - for instance, this could be Windows Server 2019. This would be an L1 or level 1 hypervisor. Finally, in our example, inside that OS, you could create a virtual machine to run a workload.  This could in fact also contain a hypervisor, which would be known as the L2 or level 2 hypervisor, and so the process continues, with multiple levels of nested virtualization possible.

### Important Note ###
The use of nested virtualization in this evaluation guide is aimed at providing flexibility for **evaluating AKS on Azure Stack HCI in test environment**, and it shouldn't be seen as a substitute for real-world deployments, performance and scale testing etc. With each level of nesting, comes the trade-off of performance, hence for **production** use, **AKS on Azure Stack HCI should be deployed on validated physical hardware**, of which you can find a vast array of choices on the [Azure Stack HCI 20H2 Catalog](https://aka.ms/azurestackhcicatalog "Azure Stack HCI 20H2 Catalog") or the [Windows Server Catalog](https://www.windowsservercatalog.com/results.aspx?bCatID=1283&cpID=0&avc=126&ava=0&avq=0&OR=1&PGS=25 "Windows Server Catalog") for systems running Windows Server 2019 Datacenter edition.

Deployment Overview
-----------
For those of you who don't have multiple server-class pieces of hardware running Azure Stack HCI 20H2 or Windows Server 2019, this evaluation guide will detail deploying AKS on Azure Stack HCI inside an Azure VM, using **nested virtualization**.

![Architecture diagram for AKS on Azure Stack HCI nested in Azure](media/nested_virt_arch_ga.png "Architecture diagram for AKS on Azure Stack HCI nested in Azure")

In this configuration, you'll take advantage of the nested virtualization support provided within certain Azure VM sizes. You'll first deploy a single Azure VM running Windows Server 2019 Datacenter. Inside this VM, you'll enable the Hyper-V and DNS roles, and download the necessary software to deploy AKS on Azure Stack HCI. You'll then deploy the AKS on Azure Stack HCI management cluster, and worker node clusters. All of this, in a single Azure VM!

### Important Note ###
The steps outlined in this evaluation guide are **specific to running inside an Azure VM**, running a single Windows Server 2019 OS, without a domain environment configured. If you plan to use these steps in an alternative environment, such as one nested/physical on-premises, or in a domain-joined environment, the steps may differ and certain procedures may not work. If that is the case, please refer to the [official documentation to deploy AKS on Azure Stack HCI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/aks-hci/ "official documentation to deploy AKS on Azure Stack HCI").

Deployment Workflow
-----------
This guide will walk you through deploying a sandboxed AKS on Azure Stack HCI infrastructure. To accommodate different preferences, we've provided paths for those of you who prefer PowerShell, or GUI (Graphical User Interface, such as Windows Admin Center)-based deployments.

The general flow will be as follows:

![Evaluation guide workflow using nested virtualization](media/flow_chart_ga.png "Evaluation guide workflow using nested virtualization")

**Part 1 - Deploy Windows Server 2019 Hyper-V host in Azure**: In this step, you'll create a suitable VM in Azure using PowerShell or an Azure Resource Manager template. This VM will run Windows Server 2019 Datacenter, with the full desktop experience.  On this system, you'll enable the necessary roles and features and accompanying management tools, and configure networking to enable network communication between sandbox VMs, and out to the internet.

**Part 2 - Deploy AKS on Azure Stack HCI**: In this step, you'll use **either Windows Admin Center, or PowerShell** to deploy AKS on Azure Stack HCI - this will consist of first deploying the necessary management cluster, then followed by a target cluster, for running workloads.

**Part 3 - Explore AKS on Azure Stack HCI Environment**: With your deployment completed, you're now ready to explore many of the aspects within the AKS on Azure Stack HCI. We'll also provide links to further scenarios and resources to continue your evaluation.
