Microsoft is deprecating the AKS hybrid cluster provisioning from Azure (preview) features and replacing them with the release version of the feature set in the next two months. This decision was made after careful consideration of our product roadmap and the needs of our customers.

We understand that this change may impact your workflow, and we are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible.

Our team is working hard to provide steps and processes to help transition workloads from the preview AKS clusters to the release version of AKS hybrid. We will post these in this document as we get closer to the transition date. You will also receive email communication from Azure on the steps to take as soon as they are ready. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to us by [opening a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/aks-hybrid/issues). We appreciate your understanding and continued support.
